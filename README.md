# Recap Project I: Quiz App - Layout

In this project I build the layout of my first mobile web application, a quiz app. In later projects I will expand this app and add all sorts of cool functionality. In this app you will be able to:

- Read questions and click buttons to look up the answers
- Bookmark questions and view them on a bookmarks page
- Visit your profile page & edit your Profile
- Add new Quiz-Cards

I made this app during my course @ [neuefische](https://github.com/neuefische)

You can check a demo on [vercel](https://quiz-m9l5unsb9-milodevhh.vercel.app/)

The app is bulid with:
